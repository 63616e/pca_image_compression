# pca_image_compression

Because I ran out of things to do, I did dimensionality reduction on Aslan (the cat) and see how many components would be the best to keep in order to preserve the most clarity while reducing the size as best as possible. I've kept it in B&W to keep the computation small as it'd require the least amount of channels, and therefore the pictures are easier to compute.

## Data Sources: 
Aslan (the cat)
